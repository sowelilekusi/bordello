#Ideas okay?
#Make the client cards have a little progress track thats like how much they like their service right,
#put the poor/good/great blocks along that track, and instead of the services having that each service 
#contributes a different number of points along that other track, so the money you recieve for making
#the match can be the same across all clients, but it shows how some clients value one more over the other
#without actually requiring you to have any specific one as long as you have enough turns to get them along
#the track, so a short session with all the perks can be a great service but a less special or less
#stress inducing session needs to be longer so the same worker needs to remain occupied longer, and it gives
#you more to do on your turn because you get to decide what all your little workers do rather than them only
#being interacted with when you're placing down a client card
