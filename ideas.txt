Ideas okay?
Make the client cards have a little progress track thats like how much they like their service right,
put the poor/good/great blocks along that track, and instead of the services having that each service 
contributes a different number of points along that other track, so the money you recieve for making
the match can be the same across all clients, but it shows how some clients value one more over the other
without actually requiring you to have any specific one as long as you have enough turns to get them along
the track, so a short session with all the perks can be a great service but a less special or less
stress inducing session needs to be longer so the same worker needs to remain occupied longer, and it gives
you more to do on your turn because you get to decide what all your little workers do rather than them only
being interacted with when you're placing down a client card

the roster system is kind of fucked if you start with 2/4 cards and dont get new ones often
like, you would never have any in reserve, but do u need any? idk figure it out

Shift Phase
	1. Swap 1 time token on each worker over to the stress side
	2. Pick up the next client card in the deck, and either assign it to 
	   a worker or place it in the no service pile
	3. If a worker both has no client, and at least one stress token, remove
	   a stress token

Management Phase
	Market Research
		Look at the 10 clients, and place them back in the same order
	Targeted Advertising
		Search through the client discard deck, and add all clients
		with one extra type to your shift deck
	Roster Worker
		Add 1 worker from your hand into the next open slot on your board
